# DSA Solutions

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! In this repository, I upload solutions to problems that I solve daily related to Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. The goal is to improve my understanding of algorithms, help me with my learning, and provide a reference for anyone interested in improving their problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

- **Problem Folders**: Each folder contains solutions to problems based on specific data structures or algorithms.
- **Daily Solutions**: Every day's solution is uploaded as a new Java file within the respective folder.

## Topics Covered

Some of the topics I cover in this repository include:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Searching and Sorting
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation

## How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the problem or topic you are interested in.
2. Open the Java files in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Run the solution to understand the approach to solving the problem.

## My Goals

The main objectives of this project are:
- To track my progress in solving DSA problems using Java.
- To enhance my problem-solving skills through regular practice.
- To build a habit of coding daily.
- To provide helpful solutions for others learning DSA.
