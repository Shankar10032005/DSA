# Nth Fibonacci Number

## Problem Statement:
The n-th term of the Fibonacci series `F(n)` is calculated using the formula:  
**F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)**
Where:
- `F(1) = 1`
- `F(2) = 1`

Given an integer `n`, find the n-th Fibonacci number.

**Note:** The series indexing starts from 1. Handle edge cases like `n = 1` or `n = 2` using conditionals.

## Examples:

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`n = 6`  

**Output:**  
`8`  

**Explanation:**  
The Fibonacci series is: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...]`.  
The 6th element is `8`.
