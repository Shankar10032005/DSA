# Java Switch Case Statement

## Problem Statement:
Given an integer `choice` and a list of values:  
- If `choice` is `1`, calculate the area of a circle with the given radius `R`.  
- If `choice` is `2`, calculate the area of a rectangle with the given length `L` and breadth `B`.  

Use `Math.PI` for the value of π.

## Examples:

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`choice = 1, R = 5`  
**Output:**  
`78.53981633974483`  
**Explanation:**  
The choice is 1, so the area of the circle is calculated using the formula:  
`Area = π × R²`

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`choice = 2, L = 5, B = 10`  
**Output:**  
`50`  
**Explanation:**  
The choice is 2, so the area of the rectangle is calculated using the formula:  
`Area = L × B`
