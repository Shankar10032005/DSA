## Examples:

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`a = 1, b = 2`  

**Output:**  
`2 4`  

**Explanation:**  
- `1` was passed by value, and its updated value is `2`.  
- `2` was passed by reference, and its updated value is `4`.  

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`a = 10, b = 20`  

**Output:**  
`11 22`  

**Explanation:**  
- `10` was passed by value, and its updated value is `11`.  
- `20` was passed by reference, and its updated value is `22`.

## Instructions:
1. Write a function `passedBy` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input parameters.  
2. Return an array of two integers where the first value represents the updated value of `a` and the second value represents the updated value of `b`.
